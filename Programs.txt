* Question 1

Triangle

 We have triangles made of wodden blocks. The topmost row has 1 block, the next row down has 2 blocks, the next row has 3 blocks, and so on. Compute recursively (no loops or multiplication) the total number of blocks in such an arrangement of triangles with the given number of rows.

For example,

    triangle(2) â†’ 3

Function specification:

int triangle(int n)



Input format
Input consists of a single integer corresponding to the number of triangles

Output format
The output consists of a single integer corresponding to the total number of blocks

* Question 2

A recursive method should return the reverse of a N digit number

* Question 3

The recursive method should return the number of ways to express x as sum of n-th powers of unique natural numbers

*Question 4
 The recursive method should display the last non-zero digit of n! 

*Question 5

The recursive method should display numbers from 1 to N
